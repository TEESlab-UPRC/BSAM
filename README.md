## About
BSAM is an agent-based electricity wholesale market simulation model which simulates the operations within a power pool central dispatch Day Ahead Market. The model simulates electricity generators as entities who progressively learn to bid their capacities in a day-ahead competitive wholesale market, with ultimate goal the maximization of their profits. In parallel, a unit commitment and optimal dispatch algorithm calculates the quantities injected by each generation unit, the system marginal price, the system costs, as well as, derived outputs such as CO2 emissions and profits of each generator. The model can support cost-benefit analysis of future policy and/or technology deployment scenarios.
